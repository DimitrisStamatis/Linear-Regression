# Simple linear regression analysis


The first project is about building a simple linear regression model in order to predict the weight of a population with height as predictor variable using the dataset  weight-height.csv. At the building of the model we use the pythons' library statsmodels  for in detail explanation for regression analysis.

Steps for this project:

Data cleaning - Univariate Analysis - Bivariate analysis - Visualization - Bulding the model using library statsmodels for in detail explanation of the 
constant and coefficient ( F-test , t-test) - checking regression assumptions using visualization techniques and and pythons' scipy library (Hypothesis testing)

# Multiple linear regression analysis


In the second project is about building a multiple linear regression model in order to predict the housing prices using several  variables as predictors  using the dataset  Housing.csv. At the building of the model we use the pythons' library statsmodels  for in detail explanation for regression analysis.

Steps for this project:

1) Data cleaning 
2) Univariate Analysis 
3) Bivariate analysis 
4) Visualization 
5) Bulding the model using library statsmodels for in detail explanation of the  constant and coefficient ( F-test , t-test) - checking regression assumptions using visualization techniques and and pythons' scipy library (Hypothesis testing)
6) Reduce the number of the variables that used as predictors using t-test , F-test , R-squared , AIC and BIC
7) Indicate outliers, leverage points and influence points of our model using Cook distance, Standardized residuals, leverage (‚Ñéùëñùëñ) and  dffits measure for influence of an observation
