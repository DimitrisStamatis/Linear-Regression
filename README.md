# Simple linear regression analysis


The first project is about building a simple linear regression model in order to predict the weight of a population with height as predictor variable using the dataset  weight-height.csv. At the building of the model we use the python's library statsmodels  for  detailed explanation of regression analysis.

Steps for this project:

Data cleaning - Univariate Analysis - Bivariate analysis - Visualization - Building the model using library statsmodels for  detailed explanation of the 
constant and coefficient ( F-test , t-test) - checking regression assumptions using visualization techniques and  python's scipy library (Hypothesis testing)

# Multiple linear regression analysis


The second project is about building a multiple linear regression model in order to predict the housing prices using several  variables as predictors  using the dataset  Housing.csv. At the building of the model we use the python's library statsmodels  for  detailed explanation of regression analysis.

Steps for this project:

1) Data cleaning 
2) Univariate Analysis 
3) Bivariate analysis 
4) Visualization 
5) Bulding the model using library statsmodels for  detailed explanation of the  constant and coefficient ( F-test , t-test) - checking regression assumptions using visualization techniques and and python's scipy library (Hypothesis testing)
6) We reduce the number of the variables that were used as predictors using t-test , F-test , R-squared , AIC and BIC
7) We indicate outliers, leverage points and influence points of our model by using Cook distance, Standardized residuals, leverage (‚Ñéùëñùëñ) and  dffits measure for influence of an observation
