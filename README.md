# Linear-regression

The first project is about building a simple linear regression model in order to predict the weight of a population with height as predictor variable using the dataset  weight-height.csv. At the building of the model we use the pythons' library statsmodels  for in detail explanation for regression analysis

Steps for this project:

Data cleaning - Univariate Analysis - Bivariate analysis - Visualization - Bulding the model using library statsmodels for in detail explanation of the 
constant and coefficient ( F-test , t-test) - checking regression assumptions using visualization techniques and and pythons' scipy library (Hypothesis testing)
